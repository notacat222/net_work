  <h1>‘Brain’ meets the viewer with a mirror reflection of the human brain, a comment on the intimate relationship one holds with their devices. How a computer over time, becomes a mirror of their owner’s brain, and the power computers have in mimicking human brain pathways. </h1>
<h1>Machines are able to do this through their operating network systems, an interconnected web of parts. The work presents a data set of a brain, visualizing and interacting with different senses and parts. The parametric equation serves as a metaphor for one system, that is built from and with other parts, a network that would not be able to operate by itself.</h1>

<h1>The interaction awakens a post-humanist perspective, prompting the viewer to visualise how they might fit into a network, experience and consciousness. The work is an interrogation of what lies beneath, the effect of one manipulation and an examination of shared humanity, creating a contact zone between the human and computer where the agency of each is questioned. </h1>

<h1>‘Brain’ asks the viewer to think of their social impact through contextualising their interconnectedness, and questions the damage of viewing data and elements in singularity, awakening a shared, invisible collective consciousness. </h1>
